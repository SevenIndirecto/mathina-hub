        <p>Mathina arrives at Symmetry Fair, where she finds a huge fun fair: there are roller coasters,
        carousels and many stalls, all with countless games and challenges. Mathina is fascinated with so many
        amusements and activities and is eager to try them all! </p>
        <p>Right next to her there is a stall that sells cuddly toys! And it is full of all kinds of toys:
        puppies, teddy bears, ladybugs, ...</p>
